Which games can be splitscreened using Nucleus Co-Op?

There are a lot of supported games, the full list of supported games can be found [here(reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/fjdqid/list_of_new_supported_games_and_faq/), or [here(the hub)](https://hub.splitscreen.me/).

A ton of games are now supported thanks to the amazing program called [Goldberg Emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator), developed by Mr. Goldberg, a big thank you to him. 
Read the [Goldberg FAQ](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/blob/master/README.md) if you want to know more.
