What is Splitscreen.me?

Here's a short [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbituCgu3Bc) that explains an older version of splitscreen.me.

## General Information
Splitscreen.me is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it. The app was originally created by Lucas Assis, Zerofox later took over and added a ton of new features and improvements to support a lot more games. Ilyaki later joined in and brought multiple keyboards/mice support and more great features to the table. The app is currently being developed and updated by these three [Lucas Assis](https://github.com/lucasassislar), [Zerofox](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866) and [Ilyaki](https://github.com/ilyaki). 
Also the further development of the app wouldn't have been possible without all the amazing contributions and hard work from the SplitScreen Dreams Discord members.

The website was originally created by [r-mach](https://github.com/r-mach), and is now open sourced as well.

## History
Splitscreen.me started out as a splitscreening tool by the Brazillian game and software developer Lucas Assislar in August/September of 2012, only a few weeks after Borderlands 2's release. The app was originally created to splitscreen Borderlands 2, as there was not any way to play that game splitscreen on pc at the time. The app was called "Borderlands 2 SplitScreen Tool" at the time, fast forward a year in August of 2013 Lucas made this [post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/864977025916708574/). The app already had support for multiple games, and since the app name "Borderlands 2 SplitScreen Tool" didn't really fit any more, and the project was renamed to SplitPlay. But SplitPlay was really buggy, so a lot of people were still using the original tool for borderlands 2.

In 2014 Lucas Assis made his first [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFLCTIJHxQI) about the project, showcasing Borderlands 2 in splitscreen. 4 days later he made another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBdW1qzRUbQ) showcasing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The video was a hit, and is currently sitting at around 66k views.

Behind the scenes Lucas started working on another rebranding of the app, this time it was going to be called NucleusCoop. Lucas made version 1 of NucleusCoop in October of 2015, but didn't like the result. He rebuilt it in version 2.0, and that version got released in December of 2015 the [first version](https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleuscoop/releases/tag/v2.0-alpha-1) was released. The release was very buggy and only had support for the two previously mentioned borderlands games. In terms of functionality, NucleusCoop was a downgrade compared to SplitPlay. 
Lucas continued to improve NucleusCoop over the years, and new features were added for each release. Perhaps the first notable update came in September of 2016 with the release of Alpha 4. This release changed brought support(although very buggy) for Borderlands 1, and a new fundamental change to how the games [handlers](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/handlers/) were made. In earlier version Nucleus the handlers were made using C#, and were only available inside the system. This was problematic, since it meant that if you wanted to add a game, you had to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the entire app in order to add it. Alpha 4 however brought the javascript engine into the mix, and now you could simply make a javascript handler and add it to the app.
